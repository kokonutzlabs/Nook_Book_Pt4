# Nook_Book_Pt4 forensic investigation and reporting

## Overview
Nook_Book is a controlled forensic learning environment designed to simulate the lifecycle of a digital system, from baseline operation to incident analysis. Version 4 represents the final phase of the project, focusing on **forensic investigation, reconstruction, and reporting**.

This version analyzes the compromised datasets produced in Version 3.

---

## Version 4 Purpose
The goals of Version 4 are to:

- Conduct formal forensic analysis
- Reconstruct system activity timelines
- Identify and document incidents
- Assess data and log integrity
- Produce investigative findings and conclusions

Version 4 emphasizes **methodology, documentation, and evidence-based reasoning**.

---

## Investigation Scope

### Evidence Sources
- Interaction database records
- System log entries
- Database metadata
- Timestamps and record identifiers

### Analysis Activities
- Timeline reconstruction
- Data-to-log correlation
- Anomaly identification
- Integrity assessment
- Attribution hypotheses (where applicable)

---

## Methodology
Analysis follows basic digital forensics principles:

1. Evidence identification
2. Data examination
3. Correlation and reconstruction
4. Findings documentation
5. Conclusion and limitations

No automated forensic tools are required; analysis is performed using SQL queries and manual review.

---

## Findings & Reporting
This version produces:

- A documented list of detected incidents
- Supporting evidence for each finding
- Timeline diagrams or tables
- Observations on system weaknesses
- Limitations of the investigation

All findings are based solely on available system data.

---

## Limitations
- Logs lack integrity protections
- No ground-truth verification exists
- Attribution cannot be confirmed
- Findings rely on inference

These limitations are acknowledged as part of the forensic process.

---

## Educational Outcomes
Version 4 demonstrates:

- Practical forensic reasoning
- Challenges of incomplete evidence
- Importance of logging and integrity controls
- Value of baseline data

---

## Project Conclusion
Nook_Book illustrates the full lifecycle of a system:

1. Baseline operation
2. Visibility and logging
3. Incident introduction
4. Forensic investigation

The project highlights how early design decisions impact investigative outcomes.

## Disclaimer
This project is for **educational purposes only**.  
All data and incidents are simulated within a controlled environment.
